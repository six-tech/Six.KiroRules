# Six Kiro Rules

A comprehensive collection of Kiro AI assistant rules designed to enhance software development quality, consistency,
and productivity across multiple technology stacks. This project provides structured guidelines covering:

- **Technical documentation** - Standards for writing and maintaining project documentation
- **.NET ecosystem** - ASP.NET, Avalonia, Blazor, CI/CD, and related technologies
- **C# development** - Language-specific coding standards and best practices
- **Web technologies** - Astro, TypeScript, and modern web development frameworks
- **Specification-driven development** - Structured approaches to requirements and implementation
- **General software engineering practices** - Coding standards, testing, benchmarking, dependency management, and package publishing

## What are Kiro Rules?

Kiro Rules are configuration files that guide AI assistants in Kiro IDE to follow specific development practices, coding standards, and workflow patterns. These include:

- **Steering Files** (`.md` format) - Provide contextual guidance and best practices for specific file types or development scenarios
- **Hook Files** (`.kiro.hook` format) - Automate AI assistant actions based on file changes or user interactions

These rules ensure consistent code quality, proper documentation, and adherence to industry best practices across different domains and technologies.

## Writing New Steering Rules Using .meta.md

### What is `.meta.md`?

`.meta.md` represents the **meta-framework** and **standardized structure** used to create consistent, high-quality Kiro rules across the Six Kiro Rules collection. 

It's not a single file, but rather a **methodology and template** that ensures all rules follow the same proven structure for optimal AI assistant guidance.

### Why Use the `.meta.md` Approach?

The `.meta.md` methodology provides several key benefits:

- **üîÑ Consistency**: All rules follow the same structure, making them predictable and easy to understand
- **üéØ Clarity**: Clear role definitions and requirements help AI assistants understand their scope
- **üìù Documentation**: Standardized format ensures comprehensive coverage of topics
- **üîß Maintainability**: Common structure makes rules easier to update and maintain
- **üé® Best Practices**: Incorporates proven patterns for effective AI-assisted development

### How to Write New Rules Using `.meta.md`

#### 1. **Front Matter Structure**
Every steering rule starts with standardized front matter:

```yaml
---
description: Brief description of what this rule covers
fileMatchPattern: "*.cs", "*.ts", "*.md"  # File patterns where rule applies
inclusion: fileMatch  # Options: always, fileMatch, manual
---
```

#### 2. **Title Format**
Use the standardized title format:
```markdown
# Kiro Steering File: [Descriptive Rule Name]
```

#### 3. **Role Definition Section**
Define the AI assistant's roles and expertise areas:

```markdown
**Role Definition:**
- Primary Expert Role
- Secondary Expert Role
- Specialized Skill Area
```

#### 4. **General Section Structure**
Include these essential subsections:

```markdown
## General

### Description
Clear explanation of the rule's purpose and scope.

### Requirements
- **NEVER**: Critical restrictions (e.g., security, sensitive data)
- Specific technical requirements
- Best practices to follow
- Tools or frameworks to use
```

#### 5. **Domain-Specific Sections**
Organize content into logical sections based on the domain:

```markdown
## [Domain Area 1]
Content specific to the first major area...

## [Domain Area 2]
Content for the second major area...

### [Subsection]
Detailed guidance within a domain area...
```

#### 6. **DO/DON'T Patterns**
Use clear success/failure patterns:

```markdown
### ‚úÖ DO: Recommended Approach
```code
// Good example
```

### ‚ùå DON'T: Avoid This Pattern
```code
// Bad example to avoid
```
```

#### 7. **File Organization**
Place new rules in appropriate directories:

```
steering/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dotnet/           # .NET ecosystem rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web/             # Web technologies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ specs-generation/# Specification rules
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ documentation/   # Documentation standards
```

### Best Practices for Rule Creation

#### **Content Guidelines**
- **Be Specific**: Use concrete examples and actionable guidance
- **Include Context**: Explain why practices matter, not just what to do
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with basics, then advanced concepts
- **Cross-References**: Link to related rules when relevant

#### **Technical Requirements**
- **File Extensions**: Use `.md` for Kiro steering files, `.kiro.hook` for hook files
- **File Match Patterns**: Define specific file patterns for rule activation using `fileMatchPattern`
- **Security First**: Include security considerations in requirements
- **Testing Focus**: Emphasize testing and validation practices

#### **Documentation Standards**
- **Clear Descriptions**: Front matter descriptions should be concise but informative
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Address common scenarios and edge cases
- **Regular Updates**: Keep rules current with evolving best practices

### Example Rule Template

```markdown
---
description: Guidelines for [specific technology/practice]
fileMatchPattern: "*.extension", "path/patterns/**"
inclusion: fileMatch
---

# Kiro Steering File: [Technology/Practice] Best Practices

**Role Definition:**
- Primary Technology Expert
- Best Practices Specialist
- Implementation Guide

## General

### Description
Brief overview of what this rule covers and why it matters.

### Requirements
- **NEVER**: Critical restrictions
- Key technical requirements
- Best practices to follow

## [Main Topic Area]
Detailed guidance for the primary focus area...

## [Secondary Topic Area]
Additional guidance for related concepts...

## Special Thanks
```

### Rule Validation Checklist

Before finalizing a new rule, ensure it includes:

- [ ] Clear, descriptive front matter
- [ ] Well-defined role definitions
- [ ] Comprehensive requirements section
- [ ] Practical examples and code snippets
- [ ] DO/DON'T patterns for clarity
- [ ] Cross-references to related rules
- [ ] Security considerations
- [ ] Testing guidance
- [ ] Proper file organization

This `.meta.md` approach ensures that all Six Kiro Rules maintain high quality, consistency, and effectiveness in guiding AI-assisted development across the entire technology stack.

## Writing New Hooks

### Hook Structure

Kiro hooks are JSON configuration files with `.kiro.hook` extension that define automated AI assistant actions. Each hook consists of:

#### Basic Hook Template

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "name": "Hook Display Name",
  "description": "Brief description of what this hook does",
  "version": "1",
  "when": {
    "type": "fileEdited",
    "patterns": [
      "*.cs",
      "*.ts"
    ]
  },
  "then": {
    "type": "askAgent",
    "prompt": "Instructions for the AI assistant when this hook triggers"
  }
}
```

#### Hook Trigger Types

**File-based Triggers:**
- `fileEdited` - Triggers when specified file patterns are modified
- `fileSaved` - Triggers when files are saved
- `fileCreated` - Triggers when new files are created

**Manual Triggers:**
- `manual` - Creates a button in the UI for manual execution

#### Hook Actions

**AI Assistant Actions:**
- `askAgent` - Sends a prompt to the AI assistant with specific instructions
- `runCommand` - Executes shell commands or scripts

#### Best Practices for Hook Creation

1. **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names that explain the hook's purpose
2. **Specific Patterns**: Target specific file types to avoid unnecessary triggers
3. **Contextual Prompts**: Include relevant file references using `#[[file:path]]` syntax
4. **Performance**: Consider the frequency of triggers to avoid overwhelming the system
5. **Documentation**: Always include clear descriptions of what the hook accomplishes

#### Example Hook Categories

**Documentation Hooks:**
- Auto-update README files when code changes
- Sync API documentation with code modifications
- Generate changelog entries from commit messages

**Code Quality Hooks:**
- Run tests when source files change
- Update code comments when interfaces change
- Validate coding standards on file save

**Project Management Hooks:**
- Update project metadata when dependencies change
- Sync version numbers across project files
- Generate release notes from version changes
